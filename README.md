# Gym Calendar

For a long time, I record my motion data in diary.

Since record is plain text and dispersed, it is hard to review all of it.

One day, night actually, an idea just emrge in my brain:

> As a software developer, why don't you design a system to manage your motion data and visualize it.

So, I create this repository to make it done.
